This page contains my work for SPAX212: Introduction to Sport Analytics at the University of Delaware. The professor for this course, Nataliya Bredikhina, is an Assistant Professor of Sport Management in the Department of Hospitality and Sport Business Management at the University of Delaware. She previously worked within professional and collegiate athletics.

Work within this repository includes data cleaning and transformation in Microsoft Excel, programming with R scripts, plots generated by the R programming, and data visualizations in Tableau. Additionally, there are homework and lab reports uploaded as .pdf files.
